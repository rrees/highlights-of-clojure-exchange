*core.logic* is based on [miniKanaren](http://minikanren.org/).

David Nolan created the library and [talked](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/3557-building-the-web-of-data-with-clojure) about some of the reasons and opportunities he sees in it.

In the same Clojure Exchange Malcom Sparks offered a practical example of using *core.logic* to [learn Italian verbs](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/3557-building-the-web-of-data-with-clojure).
