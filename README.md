# Welcome to Clojure Exchange!

LISP was invented in 1958 by John McCarthy and was implemented into machine code by Steve Russell.

Kris Jenkins gave the talk [A walking tour of Clojure's history](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/3555-a-walking-tour-of-clojures-history) that goes into more detail about the history of LISP and Clojure as a LISP dialect.
