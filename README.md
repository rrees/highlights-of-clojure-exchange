# Welcome to Clojure Exchange!

LISP was invented in 1958 by John McCarthy and was implemented into machine code by Steve Russell.

Kris Jenkins gave the talk [A walking tour of Clojure's history](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/3555-a-walking-tour-of-clojures-history) that goes into more detail about the history of LISP and Clojure as a LISP dialect.

One of the key things that makes Clojure special is its use of efficient immutable structures, these have been implemented in other languages since. Philip Potter's talk [The Persistent Data Structure Menegerie](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/3743-the-persistent-data-structure-menagerie) goes through the data structures in Clojure and how they use structure sharing to be efficient.

Clojure's support of multi-core concurrency is also a key feature of the language, Tommy Hall's talk [You came for the concurrency right?](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/4935-you-came-for-the-concurrency-right) provides an introduction to the ways that Clojure leverages functions and immutable data to deliver concurrency but also uses it as a platform to discuss the nature of concurrency and parallelism in general.
